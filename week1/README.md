# Scale and convert images using PIL
- the assessment will be done on a Virtual Machine running in the Cloud, thanks to the Qwiklabs infrastructure
- using SSH to communicate with the VM
- We'll need to go through a folder full of images and operate with each of them. On each image, you'll use PIL methods like the ones we saw in the examples,
do some preprocessing on it, and then write the new images in the right place.
